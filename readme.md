## About Project Tech
From the tech repository:

In different roles you take a well-argued position on, among other things, the privacy and security aspects of the application. You'll also learn to navigate the command line, version control with Git & GitHub and make sure code style is consistent.

Amor, the name of my dating application, is a web app where sporty students can meet and date other students.
